# 8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and
# then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
# again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?

a = 1
a = 1.2
print(a)
# output: 1.2
# yes

# Because variable is like a container which store value or we can say a name to a memory location so when we assign new value to the same memoey address(variable) it will overwrite the old one.
